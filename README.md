# Description
Viz-it is an application that allows the user to visualize NBA player statistics in a customized fashion. It essentially displays a scatterplot graph of circles, each representing an NBA player. The X and Y axes can be selected from a dropdown menu of statistics, and players can be filtered by team or position. Circle size is based on # of games played, and circle color is based on the player's team.
