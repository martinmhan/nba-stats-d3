# Description
Viz-it is a customizable NBA stats visualization tool that displays a scatterplot graph plotting each NBA player as a circle. The statistics used for the X and Y axes can be selected from dropdown menus, and players can be filtered by team or position. Circle size is based on # of games played, and circle color is based on the player's team. The actual data is retrieved via an external API, stored in a SQL database, and served via a REST API.
