# Description
Viz-it is a customizable data visualization tool for NBA stats enthusiasts. It essentially displays a scatterplot graph of circles, each representing an NBA player. The stats used for the X and Y axes can be selected from a dropdown menu, and players can be filtered by team or position. Circle size is based on # of games played, and circle color is based on the player's team.
